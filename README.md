# kbdctl

I bought a Logitech G Pro TKL RGB keyboard a few weeks ago, and now I'm sick and tired of the `Logitech G HUB` bloatware I need to install just to alter the lightshow. This is why I'm writing this barebones cli controller, to finally take care of business.

## ToDo

- [X] Locate the keyboard and get a handle to it
- [ ] Apply static color
- [ ] Apply built in animation
- [ ] Apply custom key lighting
